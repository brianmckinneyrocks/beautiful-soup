Description: Beautiful Soup is a library that makes it easy to scrape information
        from web pages. It sits atop an HTML or XML parser, providing Pythonic
        idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.
        
        # Discontinuation notice
        
        You should use the 'beautifulsoup4' package instead of this package.
        
        Development on the 3.x release of Beautiful Soup ended in 2011. With
        the sunsetting of Python 2 in 2020, the 3.x release of Beautiful Soup
        will be discontinued so that the 'beautifulsoup' package name can be
        used by a more recent release that supports Python 3.
        
        January 1, 2021 is the cutoff date. At some point after that, the
        'beautifulsoup' pip package will be updated to a recent version of
        Beautiful Soup.
        
        If you're relying on version 3 of Beautiful Soup, you should drop
        everything and port your code to Python 3. A relatively small part of
        this work will be changing your Beautiful Soup code to Beautiful Soup
        4.
